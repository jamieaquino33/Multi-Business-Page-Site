        <p id="businessdescription"> Hi, my name is Jamie Aquino. Pictured above is my 3 year old daughter, Eleanor Josephine Aquino, and my 1 year old son, Theodore Aimes Aquino. For the past 3 years I have been lucky enough to have the opportunity to be a stay at home mother. My husband and I decided that if we had children, I would want to stay home with them for their first few years of life. We made the decision based on many factors, but the main one being that I wanted to be there for every milestone and soak up every moment of them being young. I've had the joy of watching them learn and grow every day! Sure, it's definitely hard some days. But at the end of every day, I can't explain how lucky I am to get to call these sweet babies mine.</p>
