            <p> My husband, Kris Aquino, and I met in 2009 in High School. We started dating soon after. He asked me to mary him the summer of 2013, we tied the knot July 25Th of 2015. We decided that following November we wanted to try for a baby. I got pregnant in January of 2016 with my sweet Eleanor. She was born on September 21, 2016. We were in absolute awe of this tiny human we made. She was the best newborn and has continued to be the best baby I could ask for! 
                <p>When Eleanor turned 4 months old, I started feeling unwell. Not sure if my hormones were out of wack or I had something more serious going on, but I definitely knew something was off. So off to the doctor we went. Found out that day that I was 7 weeks pregnant with my little Theo. You could say this definitely came as a shock to Kris and I, but we were over the moon exited and couldn't wait to find out what gender our sweet baby would be. We found out a few weeks later we were having a little boy! This being the first boy my side of the family has had in a long time, we were all ecstatic! Theo arrived later that year on November 4, 2017, making him and Eleanor only 13 months apart.</p>

                <p> Obviously having children back to back was a challenge in itself, but staying home with them by myself was an even bigger challenge. Most people might think it would be fun to stay home and play with babies all day, while iy definitely can be, it is very hard to feed, bathe and do the essentials daily things for tiny humans while also trying to take care of yourself. </p>
