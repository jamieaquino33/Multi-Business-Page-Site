            <p> My husband, Kris Aquino, and I met in 2009 in High School. We started dating soon after. He asked me to mary him the summer of 2013, we tied the knot July 25Th of 2015. We decided that following November we wanted to try for a baby. I got pregnant in January of 2016 with my sweet Eleanor. She was born on September 21, 2016. We were in absolute awe of this tiny human we made. She was the best newborn and has continued to be the best baby I could ask for! 
                <p>When Eleanor turned 4 months old, I started feeling unwell. Not sure if my hormones were out of wack or I had something more serious going on, but I definitely knew something was off. So off to the doctor we went. Found out that day that I was 7 weeks pregnant with my little Theo. You could say this definitely came as a shock to Kris and I, but we were over the moon exited and couldn't wait to find out what gender our sweet baby would be. We found out a few weeks later we were having a little boy! This being the first boy my side of the family has had in a long time, we were all ecstatic! Theo arrived later that year on November 4, 2017, making him and Eleanor only 13 months apart.</p>

                <p> Obviously having children back to back was a challenge in itself, but staying home with them by myself was an even bigger challenge. Many people don't consider being a Stay At Home Mom a job. But, it definitely is. And it is the hardest job I have ever had. It is a challenge to feed, bathe and do the essentials daily things for tiny humans while also trying to take care of yourself. You don't get to stop working when it turns 5 o'clock. You can't take weekends off. You don't get vacation time. It is 24 hours of work, 7 days a week. But I wanted to be the one to do all of that for these small humans I brought in to this world.</P>
                    <p> And let's not forget the money aspect of being a stay at home mom. I was a Bank Teller when I got pregnant with Eleanor. My check would barely have been enough to cover childcare for one child, let alone two! This was another huge factor in me staying home. </p>
                     <p>I have grown more as a person through this experience and like to think I provided the best care possible for my children. I like to think I have very bright cildren and that I am a big reason they have learned as much as they have in their first years of their life. I hope I have instilled good morals and values that they can carry with them throughout life. </p>
